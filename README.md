# CS50-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-Final-Project
## ur greeter website
#### Description:
I used Flask framework from Python, html and css. This website was built as my final project for CS50, and the mean of that was to actually mix all the skillset given throughout the course. All thses skills would equip for building a complete web application, and anyone can comeup with new ideas to present them to the world.


mine is this greeter website,This web application would show you a greeting message,once you enter your name in the given box. This project is a combination of backend features like get nad post method to receive input from the user and send back data to the user according to the input they have entered; so it's not just the static features of a website like CSS and HTML, but also includes dynamic features so the user can interact with a website to actually receive output from it based on the preferences as the user has entered namely input.
